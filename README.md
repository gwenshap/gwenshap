### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gwen Shapira. Currently a co-founder of Nile: https://www.thenile.dev
If you want to contact me or learn a bit more about me, my Bento is a good starting point: https://bento.me/gwenshap

I plan to add here a bunch of links to things I wrote, presented or recorded. I worked on a bunch of different areas over the years and I figured its time to pull things together in one place. 

## Nile

### Blogs
* [Transaction Isolation in Postgres, explained](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/transaction-isolation-postgres) - probably my most popular blog, ever.
* [Things DBs don't do - but should](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/app/blog/things-dbs-dont-do) - my thoughts on where databases are going
* [Tenant virtualization in 5 lines of code](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/app/blog/tenant-virtualization-four-lines) - trying to explain the value of Nile with one short code snippet
* [Hacking SaaS](https://hackingsaas.thenile.dev) - Monthly newsletter where I curate good links for SaaS developers
* I used to maintain a [personal blog](https://dev.to/gwenshap) where I shared lessons learned while building various bits of Nile. The one about [troubleshooting misconfigured network on AWS](https://dev.to/gwenshap/investigating-15s-http-response-time-in-aws-ecs-2gge) is my favorite.

## Kafka, event streams and microservices

### Blogs
* From 2016 to 2019 I maintained a [personal blog](https://medium.com/@gwenshapira) on Medium. It is not very technical, just random thoughts about communities, careers, work, etc. 

### Videos and presentations
* [Keynote at Kafka Summit 2020 - Kafka's New Architecture](https://youtu.be/lChAV7ibjHw?si=54iGUKUI6BWqmlxd)
* **Beyond Microservices - Streams, State and Scalability** - Probably my favorite talk. I discuss the evolution of microservices and how I see it evolve in the future. I was wrong about the future, but still great overview on the state of Microservices. I presented it at Goto Chicago ([slides](https://files.gotocon.com/uploads/slides/conference_21/1370/original/GOTO%20Chicago%20-%20Beyond%20Microservices.pdf), video) and at QCon SF. 
* [Monitor disk space and other ways to keep Apache Kafka happy](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca/public/schedule/speaker/126882.html) - a talk I gave at Velocity, a devops conference. One of the very few devops talks I gave.
* [Magic Rebalance Protocol of Apache Kafka](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/the-magical-rebalance-protocol-of-apache-kafka.html) - it was a joy and an honor to give a talk at StrangeLoop. I also think it is a pretty fun talk. Goes deep into internals and not super practical, but lots of fun.
* [Spark Summit: Stream All Things - Patterns of Data Integration](https://youtu.be/X5IPGtregtQ?si=uFvyAshjNeVADhxj)
* [Ask Confluent Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7VYi0yPIH0snucuYWkuUXwasMr-HR7Y&si=I-0nA__DZ9fdo6gA) - For 3 years, I've answered Kafka questions and interviewed experts on Confluent's YouTube channel.



## Cloudera and Hadoop
* [Scaling ETL with Hadoop](https://www.slideshare.net/gwenshap/scaling-etl-with-hadoop-avoiding-failure)
  
## Oracle

## Recording Setup
A lot of folks asked for it, so here we go: 
* Camera:
  * Sony FX30, recording directly to my laptop via USB.
  * Lens: Sigma 16mm f/1.4 DC DN Contemporary Lens (Sony E)
  * Camera tripod is on my desk: Oben CTT-1000 Carbon Fiber Tabletop Tripod (I tried about 100 tripods and setups. This one works. Barely). 
* Lights:
  * I have two warm, bright lights (4000k): one to my front and right, showing my face, and the other on my back and left, bouncing off a wall and my hair. The technically correct setup has two front lights, but I ran out of room.
  * Both are: Amaran COB 60x S Bi-Color LED Monolight
  * Front light has a softbox: Aputure Light Dome Mini III (22.8")
  * Front light has a heavy-duty stand: Impact Folding Wheeled Base Stand (Black/Chrome-plated, 11')
  * Back light is connected to the ceiling (my cats kept jarring the stand)
  * The orange decorative light on my back right side is: Aputure MC RGBWW LED Light
  * I got blackout curtains for my office to make the lighting consistent.
* Audio:
  * Rode Procaster mic
  * Mic arm: Elgato Wave LP (low profile). I also tried the Rode mic arm; it is great, but low profile doesn't get in the way. I have very limited space.
  * Rode PSM1 shock mount (important if you wave your arms like me)
  * Triton Fet head booster (so I can move the mic away from my face)
  * Vocaster two interface. I keep getting tempted to buy a fancier one, but I resist. This one is just fine.
* No desktop controllers. I tried one from Elgato. It looks like a good idea. But didn't work for me.
* Process:
  * This went through many iterations, but this one seems to stick.
  * Record with ScreenFlow (currently v10)
  * Rough edit with Screenflow. Cut out the sections that didn't work. Right screen size, zoom-in and out, callouts, transitions between me and the screen recording.
  * Fine tune with Descript. Mostly cut out all the "ehhh". Also do captions if I feel like having captions.
