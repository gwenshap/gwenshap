### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gwen Shapira. Currently a co-founder of Nile: https://www.thenile.dev
If you want to contact me or learn a bit more about me, my Bento is a good starting point: https://bento.me/gwenshap

I plan to add here a bunch of links to things I wrote, presented or recorded. I worked on a bunch of different areas over the years and I figured its time to pull things together in one place. 

## Nile

## Kafka, event streams and microservices

## Cloudera and Hadoop

## Oracle
