### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gwen Shapira. Currently a co-founder of Nile: https://www.thenile.dev
If you want to contact me or learn a bit more about me, my Bento is a good starting point: https://bento.me/gwenshap

I plan to add here a bunch of links to things I wrote, presented or recorded. I worked on a bunch of different areas over the years and I figured its time to pull things together in one place. 

## Nile

### Blogs
* [Transaction Isolation in Postgres, explained](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/transaction-isolation-postgres) - probably my most popular blog, ever.
* [Things DBs don't do - but should](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/app/blog/things-dbs-dont-do) - my thoughts on where databases are going
* [Tenant virtualization in 5 lines of code](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/app/blog/tenant-virtualization-four-lines) - trying to explain the value of Nile with one short code snippet
* [Hacking SaaS](https://hackingsaas.thenile.dev) - Monthly newsletter where I curate good links for SaaS developers
* I used to maintain a [personal blog](https://dev.to/gwenshap) where I shared lessons learned while building various bits of Nile. The one about [troubleshooting misconfigured network on AWS](https://dev.to/gwenshap/investigating-15s-http-response-time-in-aws-ecs-2gge) is my favorite.

## Kafka, event streams and microservices

### Blogs
* From 2016 to 2019 I maintained a [personal blog](https://medium.com/@gwenshapira) on Medium. It is not very technical, just random thoughts about communities, careers, work, etc. 

### Videos and presentations
* **Beyond Microservices - Streams, State and Scalability** - Probably my favorite talk. I discuss the evolution of microservices and how I see it evolve in the future. I was wrong about the future, but still great overview on the state of Microservices. I presented it at Goto Chicago ([slides](https://files.gotocon.com/uploads/slides/conference_21/1370/original/GOTO%20Chicago%20-%20Beyond%20Microservices.pdf), video) and at QCon SF. 
* [Monitor disk space and other ways to keep Apache Kafka happy](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca/public/schedule/speaker/126882.html) - a talk I gave at Velocity, a devops conference. One of the very few devops talks I gave.
* [Magic Rebalance Protocol of Apache Kafka](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/the-magical-rebalance-protocol-of-apache-kafka.html) - it was a joy and an honor to give a talk at StrangeLoop. I also think it is a pretty fun talk. Goes deep into internals and not super practical, but lots of fun.



## Cloudera and Hadoop
* [Scaling ETL with Hadoop](https://www.slideshare.net/gwenshap/scaling-etl-with-hadoop-avoiding-failure) 
## Oracle
